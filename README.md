## About

ValheimTooler is a free tool with a large set of cheats and admin helpers for Valheim. It is for educational and private use. Some features will wreck a normal playthrough, especially on multiplayer servers. Use them with care.

This repository is a **community fork** of [Astropilot/ValheimTooler](https://github.com/Astropilot/ValheimTooler) by Yohann MARTIN (Astropilot). The original project last targeted Valheim 0.219.x and is not maintained for Valheim 1.0.

**This fork is 1.12.0** and is updated for **Valheim 1.0.7** (Deep North).

  * Send a event message to all players (the yellow one on the middle of the screen)
  * Send a chat message as any username
  * A ESP for players, monsters, pickables, deposits and drops with radius setting

**Warning**: On each feature that allows you to choose a player, the list will only include players who are at a certain distance from you. That is a game limitation, not a fork choice.

| | Original | This fork |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Author | [Astropilot](https://github.com/Astropilot) (Yohann MARTIN) | [Haroziplove](https://github.com/Haroziplove) |
| Last official release | 1.11.x for Valheim 0.219.14 | **1.12.0 for Valheim 1.0.7** |
| Source | [Astropilot/ValheimTooler](https://github.com/Astropilot/ValheimTooler) | [Haroziplove/ValheimTooler](https://github.com/Haroziplove/ValheimTooler) |

1.12.0 changes for Valheim 1.0:

* Harmony no longer crashes when `InventoryGrid.OnRightClick` is missing (1.0 uses `OnLeftDown` / `OnRightDown`)
* Inventory, chat, pins, stamina, and terrain APIs updated for 1.0
* Item Giver keeps items whose preview icons fail (gray placeholder)
* Kall and other `GP_*` guardian powers are picked up from the game data

## Install

ValheimTooler can be injected without modifying the game installation:

1. Start Valheim normally through Steam and wait for the main menu.
2. Put the merged `ValheimTooler.dll`, `ValheimToolerInjector.exe`, and `SharpMonoInjector.dll` together in any folder outside the game directory.
3. Run `ValheimToolerInjector.exe` and press **Del** in game to show or hide the window.

Windows Defender may flag process injection. If it blocks the injector, add an exclusion for the folder containing these three files.

The BepInEx path remains supported: install [BepInEx for Valheim](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/denikson/BepInExPack_Valheim/) and copy `ValheimTooler.dll`, `ValheimToolerMod.dll`, and `SharpConfig.dll` into `BepInEx/plugins/ValheimTooler/`.

To build from source, restore NuGet packages and build `ValheimTooler` and `ValheimToolerInjector` as **Release | x64** against your local Valheim install. Override the default location with `/p:ValheimPath=C:\path\to\Valheim`. The merged assembly is written to `ValheimTooler/bin/x64/Release/merged/ValheimTooler.dll`.

For an old pre-1.0 build you can use [the original releases](https://github.com/Astropilot/ValheimTooler/releases). Those builds do **not** work on Valheim 1.0.

If an install breaks the game, use Steam's "Verify integrity of game files".

## Usage

A config file is created on first launch:

`%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\IronGate\Valheim\ValheimTooler\valheimtooler_settings.cfg`

You can change the toggle key (default Delete), whether the window starts visible, language, and feature shortcuts.
